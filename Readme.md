The project **Bürkelens** was developed for the Electronic Publishing and Digital Storytelling course held by Prof. Marilena Daquino and part of the Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge Master's Degree at the University of Bologna. The project features an analysis of the photo collection of German art historian **Ludwig von Bürkel**, donated to the **Photothek** of the **Kunsthistorisches Institut** in Florence in **1912**. It focuses on the **data analysis** of the collection and its relation with the **overall collection of the Photothek**.
The goal of the project is to assess the **impact** of Ludwig von Bürkel's collection on the overall collection of the KHI and to determine the **categories** on which the collection had a relevant impact, in particular to show the contribution of the collection in terms of artists, geographical reference, artistic periods, photographers, and locations.
